This library reads (mainly GTA) Renderware files from the following platforms:

DFF: Generic (PC), PS2, Xbox, OpenGL (Mobile)

TXD: PC, PS2, Xbox

Some chunks are not read and thus skipped as of now, though.

It can also write generic DFFs and PC TXDs so you can convert files
to the familiar PC format.
Some useful example programs can be found in `bin` after compilation.

To compile, simple type `make`. Use MinGW/MSYS on Windows.

The code is public domain, do what you want with it.
